# Netcom Projects: Multiclass Classification & Regression

## Overview
During my academic journey in #ArtificialNeuralNetworks and DeepLearning courses, I had the privilege to work on two pioneering #projects, both aiming to explore the capabilities of neural networks in complex applications. These projects, "Netcom_MulticlassClassification" and "Netcom_Regression," demonstrate the practical application and effectiveness of neural networks in classification and regression tasks.

### Netcom_MulticlassClassification
This project focuses on a multiclass classification task, where the objective is to design and train a neural network capable of identifying the species of a plant from an image of its leaf. Key challenges included data preprocessing, data augmentation to expand the training dataset, and anomaly detection methods to enhance model accuracy.

### Netcom_Regression
The second project addresses a regression problem, predicting future trends in a multivariate time series based on past observations. It involves handling temporally correlated data, model fine-tuning for optimized performance, and rigorous result evaluation.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Keras, TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn

## Key Features
- **Netcom_MulticlassClassification:** Classify images of plant leaves into their respective species (e.g., tomato, raspberry, squash, soybean, potato, pepper, peach, orange, grape, corn, cherry, blueberry, apple).
- **Netcom_Regression:** Make predictions on numerical series attributes (e.g., sponginess, wonder level, crunchiness, loudness on impact, meme creativity, soap slipperiness, hype root).

## Installation
The projects are shared as IPython Notebooks (.ipynb files) and can be directly uploaded to Google Colab. For retraining the models, it's recommended to use Google's provided GPUs for optimal performance.

## Usage
To use these projects, follow these steps:
1. Download the .ipynb files for either "Netcom_MulticlassClassification" or "Netcom_Regression".
2. Upload the files to Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebooks to run or retrain the models.

## Dependencies
The only dependencies are the datasets used for training the models, which are detailed within the notebooks.

## Contributing
These projects were developed as part of my academic coursework and are primarily for demonstration purposes. While not actively seeking contributions, I am open to feedback and suggestions.
Special thanks to my colleague and team mate Alessia Luoni.
